-- Security tests to verify RLS policies and data isolation
-- These tests should be run to ensure users can only access their own data

-- Test 1: Verify users cannot access other users' profiles
-- This should return 0 rows when executed as a different user
SELECT 'Test 1: Profile isolation' as test_name;
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM core.profiles WHERE user_id != auth.uid();

-- Test 2: Verify users cannot access other users' education records
SELECT 'Test 2: Education isolation' as test_name;
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM core.education WHERE user_id != auth.uid();

-- Test 3: Verify users cannot access other users' experience records
SELECT 'Test 3: Experience isolation' as test_name;
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM core.experience WHERE user_id != auth.uid();

-- Test 4: Verify users cannot access other users' skills
SELECT 'Test 4: Skills isolation' as test_name;
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM core.skills WHERE user_id != auth.uid();

-- Test 5: Verify users cannot access other users' certifications
SELECT 'Test 5: Certifications isolation' as test_name;
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM core.certifications WHERE user_id != auth.uid();

-- Test 6: Verify users cannot access other users' referees
SELECT 'Test 6: Referees isolation' as test_name;
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM core.referees WHERE user_id != auth.uid();

-- Test 7: Verify users cannot access other users' jobs
SELECT 'Test 7: Jobs isolation' as test_name;
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gen.jobs WHERE user_id != auth.uid();

-- Test 8: Verify users cannot access other users' documents
SELECT 'Test 8: Documents isolation' as test_name;
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gen.documents WHERE user_id != auth.uid();

-- Test 9: Verify storage object access isolation
SELECT 'Test 9: Storage isolation' as test_name;
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM storage.objects WHERE auth.uid()::text != (storage.foldername(name))[1];

-- Test 10: Verify signed URL generation works for own objects only
SELECT 'Test 10: Signed URL security' as test_name;
-- This should succeed for own objects and fail for others

/*
Instructions for running these tests:

1. Create two test users in Supabase Auth
2. Add sample data for both users in all tables
3. Execute these queries while authenticated as each user
4. Verify that all cross-user queries return 0 rows
5. Test the generate_signed_url function with valid and invalid object paths

Expected results:
- All isolation tests should return 0 rows when querying other users' data
- Users should only see their own data in all tables
- Storage access should be restricted to user's own folder
- Signed URL generation should fail for objects not owned by the user
